# [dreamscape](https://github.com/Billy-Budd/dreamscape/)
 Project files from OS Concepts with Greg Ozbirn. This will contain all my code for all the projects included in this class. Please refer to the subsections in this readme for information about each project, notes, and naming. They will be listed in order, starting with the first project and continuing down. 

 I chose this name for the 'super repository' since it has deep roots in online tutorials on early YouTube, especially ones relating to doing things on your computer. [Dreamscape](https://youtu.be/0Xa3lfd0ukk) by 009 Sound System, or Alexander Perls, is a staple among the Creative Commons licensing sounds and you can read more about on [Perls' wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Perls#YouTube). 

 ## [a-mask-of-my-own-face](/a-mask-of-my-own-face/)
 This is just a collection of examples for my use on multiple devices. These are just some given sample files that we can use as guides and examples for our projects. We were also given a choice to make this in C or Java, and I chose C as I am more comfortable with it given my work on [magic-spells](https://github.com/Billy-Budd/magic-spells) and familiarity with forks and pipes in C. 

 The namesake of this folder is from [Neil Cicierega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Cicierega)'s song of the same name, [A Mask of My Own Face](https://youtu.be/8ws-49HHK60). Neil is famous for a few reasons, most notably the early YouTube videos called the Potter Puppet Pals or from his incredibly catchy 2016 record named [Spirit Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_Phone) under his musical persona Lemon Demon. I chose this name because it's a pretty fun song, and it has this idea of repetition and copying which I felt was fitting for a folder with some examples to work off of. This song comes from a separate EP called [Nature Tapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Tapes) which has some deeper cuts of his singles from the years 2010-2013 as a way of 'cleaning up his bandcamp page.' One last note for this is that his mashup series (named The Mouth Mashup Albums) has been a staple for my taste in music for many, many years. 

 ## [aint-it-funny](/aint-it-funny/)
 Files from the first project. The namesake of this is from the 2016 album [Atrocity Exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrocity_Exhibition_(album)) by [Danny Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Brown). I love this song specifically because of its unique sample from [Nick Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason)'s, the drummer of [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd), solo album titled [Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason%27s_Fictitious_Sports) which is an eclectic album to say the least. I feel that a lot of people compare him to Ringo in the way that "he was in the right place at the right time," but I think his contributions to early Pink Floyd are under-appreciated as he brought a unique sound to the drums that greatly improves their more epic songs such as [Astronomy Domine](https://youtu.be/8UbNbor3OqQ), [Echoes](https://youtu.be/53N99Nim6WE), and the live version of [Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun](https://youtu.be/KVwdB3sM2L8). I also believe this of [Richard Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician)), who played the piano and keyboard for Pink Floyd, and also had some great [solo work](https://youtu.be/o2bzxFcdQic) as well as creating many of my favorite moments and songs from Pink Floyd. However, I've gotten quite off-track. [Ain't it Funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-d65oe8s1E) samples a song called [Wervin'](https://youtu.be/wpqL12AIo4E), creating one of the most unique beats in hip-hop that I have heard, and Danny brings out some of my favorite bars such as "I can sell honey to a bee" and "Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors." I apologize for this tangent, but it's a song with a lot of lore that I wanted to share with anyone who happened to look at my repository.
